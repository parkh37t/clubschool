# Clubschool Project Dashboard Prototype

This repository contains a lightweight prototype for a responsive web dashboard
used to manage project members across the planning, design, and publishing
groups. The dashboard shows each participant's role, allocation period, and
utilization rate in one view.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the dashboard. The interface is fully
client-side and uses static sample data defined in `app.js`.

## Development

- `index.html`: Main page rendering the dashboard.
- `styles.css`: Basic responsive layout using Flexbox.
- `app.js`: Sample data and dynamic table rendering logic.

## Testing

A placeholder test script is provided. Run:

```bash
npm test
```

This will output a message confirming there are currently no automated tests.
